## Functionality

This app is designed to let the customer purchase items from a MYSQL database.  Upon loading, the customer will see 10 products, the quantity available, and the price.  When the customer decides which product and the quantity to purchase, the app will update the database with the new quantity available and calculate the total amount (in dollars) the customer owes for his/her purchase.
